Inorder to gain insights about the pizza sales I considered the below keyperformance indicators:

1. **Total Revenue:** The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.
2. **Average Order Value:** The average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders.
3. **Total Pizzas Sold:** The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.
4. **Total Orders:** The total number of orders placed.
5. **Average Pizzas Per Order:** The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.


Created charts to to visualize various aspects of our pizza sales data to gain insights and understand key trends.I identified the following requirements for creating charts:

1. Daily Trend for Total Orders
2. Hourly Trend for Total Orders
3. Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category
4. Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size
5. Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category
6. Top 5 Best Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold
7. Bottom 5 Worst Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold
